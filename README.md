# todos-vue
todos-vue is a simple web application that stores todos items using localStorage.


It was initially a course work project in my recent semester that built with Vue and Java Springboot. 
The original work is a todos system with backend real-time synchronization and user authentication.


UI is now refactoring with reference to my classmate's one, and the backend is also removed.
In other words, it is now a pure static web app.
